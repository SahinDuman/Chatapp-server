# Chat App server with Socket.io and Typescript;

Dont forget to run "npm install" if you clone this repo! 

### Run in development
"npm run dev" (nodemon)

### Run tests
"npm run test" 
or
"npm run cover" if you want a better overview, will even generate an html page with data from the tests. 

_______________________________________________________________________

Can also do:
"npm run build" --> "npm run start"
to run the compiled version of the server.

____________________________________________

Will continue working on this project after the test.

Todos:
* Handle page refresh
* Refactor to make use of the socket event callbacks (should've read the docs more before the test); 
* Improve error handling and validation. 
* Hookup a database or connect to firebase. 
* send images
